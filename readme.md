# Object Oriented Programming; CS-UY 2124 @ Tandon, Spring 2024

### Goals of Repo:

Organize and Document my journey through OOP, learning concepts and practicing C++ writing conventions. 


### Organizational STructure 

This repo will store all my relevant homework and recitation assignments.

Two major types:

- Rec__ : Denotes a recitation assignment. All assignments here are an A or A with extra credits.
- hw__: Homework. No grade will be provided. Might contain changes not representative submitted file.

Misc:

Anything that isnt marked as Rec_ or hw_ is to be assumed random code used as either practice for a midterm or the final exam. The problems or context behind the code written will not be provided and only my code will be shown.


### Disclaimer:

I did not end up using the lecture past the first lecture. Respective notes may or may not be posted to Notion database at a later date.

Final grade of the course is an A, the highest possible at NYU.
